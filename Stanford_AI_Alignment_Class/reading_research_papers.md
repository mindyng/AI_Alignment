* Applying it on this Paper: [A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03109)

First pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:
1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore
everything else
3. Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the
ones you’ve already read

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer
the five Cs:
1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A
description of a research prototype?
2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which
theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

Second pass involves reading the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. Jot down the key
points or to make comments in the margins:
1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.
Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with
error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate
rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.
2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about
the background of the paper).

At this point, should be able to understand the main purpose of the paper with supporting evidence. At this point, reading suffices interest, but not for those seeking deeper insight into research speciality.

Third pass involves _virtually reimplementing the paper_ . 
* will discover innovations and also short-comings (failings in assumptions and execution)
* challenge every assumption
* think about being the original author and how you would present research topic
* can add this to repretoire of tools for future work
* at the end, should be able to recite paper's structure from memory
* be able to identify issues with experiment or analysis too
