* Applying it on this Paper: [A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03109)

First pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:
1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore
everything else
3. Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the
ones you’ve already read

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer
the five Cs:
1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A
description of a research prototype?
2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which
theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?
