# Do Important Work

## How to get a position

1. What do recruiters look for?
* technical skills (theory, tests)
* meaningful work (apply theory in meaningful setting)
* keep on learning new skills
* success of AI Eng's (T-shaped; broad in many areas and deep in one), projects, open-sourced projects, research, internship
* horizontal - foundational skills/course work, reading research papers (with community)
* build deep, relevant project
* Saturday morning problem - can read paper/work on research/open source/fun (no short-term reward), but be consistent over time and will be MUCH better

## Selecting a Position:

1. Work with great people and great projects (read research papers, etc.)
2. Focus on the team (10-30 persons); they will influence you the most -- learning, teaching me, hard-working
3. Manager
4. Do not focus on the brand of the company since the brand is not that correlated with what my personal experience will be like. Get to know the people, evaluate the individuals.
5. Join smaller team of great people; failure mode: get recruited by big company and then will be put in a team and you end up doing BE Payment Processing using Java instead of cutting-edge ML for 1.5 years and career plateaus
6. Be cautious of non-disclosing offers as well as rotation offers since not knowing where you will be put
7. not well-known, but have elite team with 100 people doing great work
8. Choose work that allows you to learn the most and do important work (advance human condition).
9. Important work can even be done in non-tech companies and not in shiny team because value creation is higher. All tech companies working on the same thing even though its high tech, but can be cutting edge also in other industries.
