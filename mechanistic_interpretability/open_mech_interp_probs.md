4. From Latent Space Podcast: The Utility of Interpretability â€” Emmanuel Amiesen (6/6/25)
 * for Gemma, Llama, SAE's already trained, transcoders (replace MLP layers) available-- look at biology
 * attribution graph, take model and prompt and look at what happens inside of it (biology, methods); just what makes models tick
 * methods: know inside residual streams, MLP, but understanding attention better (how to decompose it)
 * understanding more what is in Limitations Section of papers; reconstruction error (dict are hard to build)
 * really exciting approach what is model doing with this prompt, but what is the model doing in general
 * many token output and doing internal exploration
